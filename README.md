##About the page

3 Tables

A table of shop products.
<br/>
A table of the basket products.
<br/>
A table of episodes.

In the frontend we can't add a product to the basket without having chosen a size before.

In the shop view we see all the products , and in the left top we see a 'Add 8 products' button , this button add the same 8 products all the time .

If we want to add a product to the basket we need to choose a size before .

All the products we add we'll be saved on the basket table and to see them we have the basket view in the top right of the screen .

In the basket view we see different things , two buttons to add and remove units of the same product , if we remove a unit and we just have one , this will be removed of the basket.

We see a button to change the size selected.

And a button to remove the product , no matter how much units we have , this button remove all of them.

In the episodes section we see different episodes of spongebob , the only interaction with this table is the like button , this button change the image to show us if we like it or not.

In the remove units button if units are 0 or less we remove the product automatically.

THANKS FOR YOUR TIME ! I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.
